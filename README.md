# bitflyer-front

## About

This project is Crypto currncy order web site, which uses bitflyer API.
This project is designed for the situation, which you cannot order on the bitflyer web.
By ordering through API, you can order directly to bitflyer order control server.

In addition to that, if needed, other currency will be added.

### Status

It's still under constraction!!
I could make status area soon but due to lack of deposit, I coudn't test it yet, which needs me to order first to show orders on the status area.

In this area, you can see your position and order status.
And you can delete the order here.
